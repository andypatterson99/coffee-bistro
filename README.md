# coffee-bistro
This is a simple project resembling an online coffee shop.
Just showing of some of my skills as a Web Developer.
FrontEnd: 
  - This is my strong point.
  - HTML/CSS, Bootstrap5 and JavaScript.
BackEnd:
  - Still have a lot to learn.
  - PHP( Looking forward to change into full JS )
  - SQL( Good for start. Looking for new DB language soon )
No Frameworks used.
  - I wanted a "raw" project so i could start fresh with the basiscs.
Design:
  - I have an `untrained` sense for UI/UX.
  - followed some color paletts suiting for the subject.
